# TalkType Testing Procedures

## Fresh Test Environment Setup

**ALWAYS use this procedure before testing a new AppImage build:**

```bash
./fresh-test-env.sh
```

This script ensures a completely clean first-run environment by:
1. Stopping all TalkType processes
2. Removing config file (`~/.config/talktype/config.toml`)
3. Removing first-run flag (`~/.local/share/TalkType/.first_run_done`)
4. Removing CUDA libraries (`~/.local/share/TalkType/cuda`)
5. Removing all model caches (small, medium, large-v3)
6. Copying latest AppImage to `~/AppImages/`
7. Verifying everything is clean with checkmarks

## Why This Matters

- **Must stop app BEFORE clearing flags**: The app recreates `.first_run_done` on shutdown
- **All caches must be cleared**: To see download progress bars for models
- **CUDA libs must be removed**: To test GPU detection and CUDA download flow
- **Config must be removed**: To test default settings

## Testing Checklist

When testing a new build, verify:
- [ ] Welcome screen appears on first launch
- [ ] GPU detection works and offers CUDA download
- [ ] CUDA download shows progress bar
- [ ] After CUDA download, green checkmark appears immediately
- [ ] Device auto-switches to "cuda" after CUDA download
- [ ] Model downloads show progress bars
- [ ] Default settings are correct (auto_period=True, auto_timeout=5min, language_mode=auto)
- [ ] Dictation works in CPU mode
- [ ] Dictation works in GPU mode after CUDA download
- [ ] Auto-punctuation works consistently

## Build and Release Process

1. Make code changes
2. Rebuild AppImage: `./build-appimage-cpu.sh`
3. Set up fresh environment: `./fresh-test-env.sh`
4. Test thoroughly with checklist above
5. If issues found, fix and repeat from step 2
6. When ready to release:
   ```bash
   git add <changed files>
   git commit -m "..."
   git push
   gh release create v0.x.x TalkType-v0.x.x-x86_64.AppImage TalkType-v0.x.x-x86_64.AppImage.zsync --title "..." --notes "..."
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Never** remove first-run flag while app is running
- **Never** skip the fresh environment setup when testing
- **Always** verify the checklist items work before releasing
- The script shows verification output - check that all items show "âœ“ Removed"
