"""A custom command must fire whichever way Whisper spelled the number.

Whisper decides for itself whether a spoken number becomes "one" or "1", and it
is not consistent. Measured across 1,073 real dictations: a number followed by a
unit came out as a digit 20 times against 3 spelled out, and counting sequences
30 against 4 — but the same spoken phrase produced both forms on different days.
Commands match the raw transcription, so a trigger containing a number fired
only when Whisper happened to pick the form the user typed.

The equivalence is applied to MATCHING only. Dictated text is untouched: what
gets typed still comes out exactly as Whisper and the normalizer produced it.
