"""Killing the dictation service must never kill the tray that owns it.

Process identification was hand-rolled at six call sites with four different
patterns, and they disagreed:

  * app.py's D-Bus quit handler used a bare "talktype", which matches the tray,
    Preferences, and any shell command that merely mentions the project path.
    Measured live during a review: six matching processes, including the dev
    tray the user runs all day.
  * tray.py and welcome_dialog.py used "-m talktype", which matches
    "-m talktype.tray" — the tray's own command line. It has never actually run:
    pkill reads a pattern starting with a dash as an option and aborts. The
    obvious repair (adding "--") would make the tray SIGKILL itself, so the
    pattern has to be narrowed rather than merely made parseable.
  * "bin/dictate" is a prefix of "bin/dictate-tray", which is the only launcher
    the shipped AppImage actually contains.

One helper now owns the rule, and these tests pin the property that matters:
it hits the service, and nothing else, above all not the tray.

The rule compares whole arguments, not substrings. pkill/pgrep -f match a regex
against the joined command line, so a shell running
`bash -c "pgrep -f talktype.app"` passed for the service. The tray cached that
PID and toggle_recording would have sent it SIGUSR1; the Preferences hotkey test
sent SIGUSR2 to the first pgrep hit. Both signals kill a process that doesn't
handle them.
