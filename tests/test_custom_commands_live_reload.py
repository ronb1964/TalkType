"""Custom voice commands must take effect without restarting the service.

The service loaded them exactly once, at startup. The live-settings watcher
stats config.toml only, and custom commands live in their own file, so an edit
in the Commands tab reached disk and stopped there. Preferences made it worse
from both directions: the Apply dialog said "your changes are already in
effect" (it diffs config.toml keys, and none had changed), while the tab's own
tip said to restart the service. One of them had to become true.

A damaged commands file must never wipe the commands the service is already
running with — the same rule the config reload follows.
