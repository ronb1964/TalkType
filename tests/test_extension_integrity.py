"""The GNOME extension is JavaScript that runs inside the user's shell, so a
tampered or truncated zip matters. Its checksum lookup had the same fail-open
shape as the updater's: any problem returned None and the install proceeded.

The fix has to distinguish two cases, because they are not the same risk:

  * the release publishes no SHA256SUMS.txt at all (404) — true of every
    release up to and including v0.5.16, so failing here would break the
    extension install for every existing user. Proceed, but say so.
  * the checksums file exists but the extension is not listed in it, or it
    could not be read for some other reason — that is a real integrity
    failure and must abort.
