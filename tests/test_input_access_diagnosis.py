"""A service that cannot read the keyboard must say so, loudly.

evdev's list_devices() returns only the device nodes the current user can
already open, and it returns an EMPTY LIST rather than raising when it cannot
open any. So a user missing 'input' group membership gets a service that starts
cleanly, prints its configured hotkey, reports itself healthy — and then
silently ignores every keypress forever.

That failure cost a full debugging session on a Fedora KDE VM: the onboarding
hotkey test passed (it always connects GTK key handlers, so it exercises the
focused-window path, not evdev), which made the dictation service look like the
broken part when the real cause was device permissions.

These tests pin the diagnosis text so the silent-failure mode cannot return.
