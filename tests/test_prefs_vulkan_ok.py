"""OK in Preferences closes the window, even right after a model download.

OK used to stay open after a download "so the user can keep adjusting", which
meant clicking OK twice. Apply is the button that keeps the window open. On
Vulkan it was worse: files that were merely present counted as a download, so
OK never closed Preferences at all (0.12.0 to 0.13.1, found 2026-10-03).
