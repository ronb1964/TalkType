"""Tests for custom voice commands (phrase → replacement).

Custom commands run on the text of every dictation, so a fault here doesn't
degrade one phrase — it breaks all dictation. These tests cover the four ways
that happened:

  * a backslash in a replacement crashed every transcription
  * one command's output was rewritten by another command
  * a trigger containing punctuation silently never matched
  * a quoted "inject exactly as written" replacement got a period appended
