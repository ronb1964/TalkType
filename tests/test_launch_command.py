"""Autostart must launch through a wrapper that sets up the bundled environment.

A packaged install ships python at /opt/talktype/usr/bin/python3, but that
interpreter has no PYTHONPATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH/GI_TYPELIB_PATH of its own — the
/usr/bin/talktype wrapper (via AppRun) sets those before launching. Writing the
raw `python3 -m talktype.tray` into the autostart .desktop therefore produces a
command that dies silently at login while a terminal `talktype` works. This bit
a real .deb install: "Launch at login" was on, but nothing started.

The launcher must resolve to the wrapper the package actually installed. It is
looked up by KNOWN ABSOLUTE PATH, not `which`, so a stray ~/.local/bin/talktype
earlier in PATH can never be written into autostart in place of ours.
