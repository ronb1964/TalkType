"""A model whose download did not finish must not stay in config.toml.

Apply/OK save the config *before* downloading, because the downloader reads the
model name out of the merged config. That ordering is deliberate, but it left a
gap: cancel or fail the download and config.toml still names the new model,
while the running service is loaded with the old one. Model changes are
deliberately excluded from the live-settings reload, so nothing corrects it.

The second half is worse than the first. save_config() also resets
_config_at_open to what it just wrote, so the retry sees no change at all:
Preferences reports "your changes are already in effect" and skips the restart,
leaving the service on the old model indefinitely.

These tests drive on_apply/on_ok with a stub `self`, which reaches the real
ordering logic without constructing a GTK window. The failure path returns
before any dialog is built, so no display is needed.
