"""Settings must apply without restarting the dictation service.

Preferences restarted the service on every Apply/OK, so toggling
auto-punctuation tore it down and reloaded a 3 GB Whisper model onto the GPU —
about ten seconds during which F8 did nothing, with no beep, no indicator and
no message.

Almost none of that was necessary. Most settings are read off the long-lived
`cfg` object at the moment they are used (every dictation ends by passing
cfg.beeps, cfg.auto_period and the rest into stop_recording), so refreshing
that object's fields makes them live. Only `model` and `device` require
rebuilding the model.
