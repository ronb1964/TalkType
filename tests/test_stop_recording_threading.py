"""stop_recording was split so Backend B (Flatpak) can run the slow half
(transcribe + portal typing) on a worker thread, keeping the F3/F4 hotkey loop
responsive instead of freezing it for 10-20s per dictation on a CPU-only box.

The correctness hinge is that _finish_capture SNAPSHOTS the audio frames on the
loop before the worker starts, so a new recording (which reassigns state.frames)
can't clobber the audio being transcribed.
