"""Every typelib the app imports UNGUARDED must be verified by the build.

The AppImage copies GObject-Introspection typelibs with two `cp ... || true`
calls, because only one of the two source directories exists on a given base
image. That is fine — but the build must then assert the *outcome*, or a
missing typelib sails through and the app dies on launch with a GI error the
user cannot act on. For a long time only AppIndicator3 was checked, so a
missing Gtk, Gdk or GdkPixbuf would have produced a good-looking build.

The distinction that matters is guarded vs unguarded:

    gi.require_version('GdkPixbuf', '2.0')   # module level → MUST be bundled
    from gi.repository import GdkPixbuf      # welcome_dialog.py, first run

    try:                                      # optional → must NOT be required
        gi.require_version('Notify', '0.7')   # app.py, sets _notify_ready
        from gi.repository import Notify
    except Exception:
        ...

Notify and Atspi are deliberately absent from the AppImage and the code already
degrades without them. Listing them in REQUIRED_TYPELIBS would hard-fail every
build for features meant to be optional — which is exactly the mistake this
test caught while it was being written.

Guardedness is detected from the AST rather than a hand-maintained exempt list,
so a new optional dependency is classified correctly without editing this file.
