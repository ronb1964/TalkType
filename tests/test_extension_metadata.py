"""The GNOME extension must declare the shell versions users are running.

GNOME Shell refuses to load an extension whose metadata does not list the
running major version. For TalkType that is worse than losing the panel menu:
tray.py's _check_tray_visibility() sees the extension as absent and activates
the GTK AyatanaAppIndicator tray instead — which stock GNOME has no host for.
The user ends up with no icon at all, and no way to reach Preferences or Quit.

GNOME 51 "A Coruna" releases 2026-09-16, so 51 has to be declared before the
next release goes out.
