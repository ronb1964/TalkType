"""Tests for exclusive input-device grabbing.

TalkType takes an exclusive grab on the keyboard while recording, so the hotkey
doesn't leak into whatever app has focus. If a grab is ever taken and not
released, the user's keyboard stops working *system-wide* until TalkType exits.

These tests pin down the invariant that makes that impossible:

    no matter how recording ends, every grab is released.
