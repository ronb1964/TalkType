"""Terminal detection must not hinge on how a compositor capitalises a class.

The focused-window class now arrives from two different sources — the GNOME
Shell extension and, on KDE, the KWin script — and they are under no obligation
to agree on case. The set already carries hand-maintained variants ("xterm",
"XTerm", "UXTerm"), which is the shape of a bug waiting for the next terminal
whose class is spelled differently than someone expected.

Real values captured from a live Plasma 6.7.4 Wayland session: Konsole reports
"org.kde.konsole" and kitty reports "kitty". Both are in the set, so this is
hardening rather than a repair.
