"""
Usage stats: how much you've dictated, and roughly how much typing it saved.

Privacy: TalkType promises that what you say never reaches the disk, so this
keeps numbers only. Per day: how many dictations, how many words, and how many
seconds of speech. Never the words themselves. The file lives in TalkType's
data folder on this computer and nothing sends it anywhere.

The dictation service records each dictation (app.py); Preferences reads the
file and shows the totals on its Stats tab. Only the service writes, one
dictation at a time, so a plain atomic rewrite is enough.
