"""
Recent dictations: the last few things the user dictated, so text that went
to the wrong window (focus stolen by a notification, a form that reloaded,
nothing focused at all) can be copied again instead of being spoken twice.

Privacy: the list lives in the user's runtime directory (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR,
normally /run/user/<uid>). That is RAM-backed tmpfs, readable only by the
user, and wiped at logout, so dictated text is never written to disk. This
matches TalkType's promise that dictated text stays out of the log.

The dictation service writes the list; the tray and the GNOME extension (via
D-Bus) read it. A small file is the simplest way to share it between those
separate processes.
