## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Speaking Clearly
- **Hold F8** throughout your entire phrase
- **Speak at normal pace** - not too fast or slow
- **Pause briefly** before and after voice commands
- **Use consistent volume** - not too quiet or loud

### Voice Command Usage
- **Say commands naturally**: "Hello there new line How are you today"
- **Commands work with punctuation**: "Hello there, new line. How are you today?"
- **Mix text and commands**: "First paragraph new paragraph Second paragraph"

### Application-Specific Behavior
- **Chat apps** (Discord, Slack): "new line" creates line breaks without submitting
- **Text editors** (VS Code, gedit): "new line" creates standard line breaks
- **Documents** (LibreOffice, Google Docs): Perfect for formatting text

## 🔧 Settings & Configuration

### Tray Menu Options
- **Start Service** - Begin voice recognition
- **Stop Service** - Stop voice recognition  
- **Preferences** - Open settings window
- **Quit** - Exit TalkType

### Hotkey
- **F8** - Press and hold to record voice input
- Change hotkey in Preferences if needed

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Combining Commands
You can chain multiple commands in one phrase:
- "Hello there new line How are you today question mark new paragraph Thanks for asking exclamation point"

### Literal Words
To type punctuation words literally (not as commands):
- **"literal period"** → types "period" (not .)
- **"the word period"** → types "period" (not .)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Voice Commands Not Working
1. **Check service status** - Tray icon should show active
2. **Hold F8 longer** - Make sure you hold throughout the phrase
3. **Speak clearly** - Ensure good microphone input
4. **Check pronunciation** - Say "new line" as two distinct words

### Line Breaks in Chat Apps
- Use **"new line"** for line breaks without submitting
- Use **"soft break"** for simple spacing
- Avoid regular Enter key behavior

### Audio Issues
1. **Check microphone** - Ensure it's working and not muted
2. **Check permissions** - TalkType needs microphone access
3. **Background noise** - Try in quieter environment
